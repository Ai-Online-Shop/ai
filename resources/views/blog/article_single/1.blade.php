    <p class="t-blog">I am sitting here in my small warehouse office, while I am staring at the sales history of my online shop and started thinking, what is artificial intelligence in eCommerce? And could it help improve my online sales? So I did a
        little research.
    </p>
    <p class="t-blog"><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in eCommerce refers to the implementation of machine learning processes intending to optimize algorithms. Some of those algorithms include: the search, product recommendation, inventory
            management, sales strategy, and communication.

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence in eCommerce</h2>
    <p class="t-blog">Looking back at the history of AI, with the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" target="_blank" class="quote-gr-blue fw500">LISP (LISt Processing)</a> language by John McCarthy in 1958, AI research was starting to set foot. Yet it took until 2011 that normal people like you and me started to pay
        attention to the topics of deep learning, big data and AI.
    </p>
    <p class="t-blog">When it comes to eCommerce the first company that comes to mind using AI is Amazon. Next, to their improved product search, another gadget is well known.
    </p>
    <p class="t-blog">
        Alexa, a virtual assistant developed by the team of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Lab126" target="_blank" class="quote-gr-blue fw500">Amazon Lab126</a>. It can read you the latest news and even play your favorite Spotify Playlist. And there is even more to it. You can even order directly from Alexa, without the hassle to
        fire up your smartphone.
    </p>
    <p class="t-blog">Let’s move on to the 5 advantages your Online Shop would get by implementing AI.</p>
</div>
<span id="2"></span>
<div class="container-content">
    <h2 class="m10">1. More effective Search Algorithm</h2>
    <p class="t-blog">With the help of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" class="quote-gr-blue fw500">machine learning</a> (AI techniques which use statistical methods to enable machines to improve with experience) the software can predict what you are searching for.</p>
    <p class="t-blog">A great example is the search algorithm of Amazon. Just try to type the first 2 letters of a product you regularly order online. Like toothbrushes or toilet paper. You will see that Amazon will suggest you exactly what you are looking for. And this is entirely based on the combination of statistics and data.</p>

<div class="container-content" style="background: #fafafa">
<h2 class="m10">2. Better Product Recommendation</h2>
<p class="t-blog">AI used for product recommendations might be the most important aspect for your business, to increase the cross-sales of your Online Shop. Similar to the search algorithms, a sufficient product recommendation algorithm would be based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" class="quote-gr-blue fw500">machine learning.</a></p>
<p class="t-blog">Generally, the more users are visiting your shop, the more data can be stored and later analyzed by the algorithm. Therefore, the final results in the cross-selling section will be more and more individualized.</p>

<p class="t-blog">Imagine the following scenario: You are the owner of an electronics online store. Your customers can buy all types of laptops, computers, and equipment. The AI would analyze already existing purchases and other data from previous customers. The analysis builds the fundament of a future prediction of customer behavior for every individual visitor in real-time.</p>
<p class="t-blog">Therefore, all product recommendations are individualized for every single customer.</p>
<h3>Let's try to put this into a context:</h3>
<p class="t-blog">A customer finds himself in the checkout process and is about to buy a brand new Asus Laptop with the latest features for a special price of 1’799$. Meanwhile, the algorithm would compare previously collected data of similar checkouts. The final cross-sales items would be chosen based on a statistic that considers customer behavior. So, one item could have been an external SSD storage, which has been purchased by 57% of other customers with similar behavior and budget.</p>
  <p class="t-blog quote-gr-blue"><strong>AI is more efficient than a random human recommendation. Why?! Cause it is not based on blind guessing, but rather on statistical predictions.</strong></p>
<p class="t-blog">You should not be surprised to detect a significant increase in your Gross Sales once the AI is overtaking the product recommendation.</p>

<div class="container-content">
  <h2 class="m10">3. Inventory Management</h2>
  <p class="t-blog">As I know from personal experience, managing inventory can be a time-consuming task. With my first Online Shop, I sold Power Banks via eBay and every night I had to manually count my stock to keep track of everything. </p>
    <amp-img alt="AI Inventory Management" layout="responsive" class="blog-picture"
    srcset="{{ asset('assets/img/blog/1/inventory/200.webp') }} 200w,

<p class="t-blog">It happened twice that I ordered one of my best-sellers too late. The consequence was that I lost my top-ranking spots to the competition. Something that should not happen twice.</p>
  <p class="t-blog">So, checking all the sales and manually updating the online stock can be an overwhelming task. Especially, when it comes to reordering best-sellers. What took me at least 1-3 hours per day, can be analyzed and precisely predicted by AI. The algorithm would use basic math for updating the stock and predict specific future trends in sales. </p>
  <p class="t-blog quote-gr-blue"><strong>In some cases, AI can even reorder goods automatically. And in such cases, the business owner can focus on what's the most important. Scaling the business and expanding the reach of the entire eCommerce store.</strong></p>
  <p class="t-blog">Looking back at the experience with my first eBay Shop, I would have been thankful for the opportunity AI would have provided me with. Especially, because these 1-3 hours of counting and reordering I could have used for sleeping as well.</p>

<div class="container-content" style="background: #fafafa">
  <h2 class="m10">4. After-Sales Service on Autopilot</h2>
  <p class="t-blog">A very well-known fact in eCommerce is that the service does not stop after an item has been sold. Customers usually reach out to ask when their order was shipped and when it will arrive. Of course, there are plenty of other concerns that a customer might have. But those two are very common ones.</p>
  <amp-img alt="AI After-Sales Service on Autopilot" layout="responsive" class="blog-picture"

  <p class="t-blog">Nevertheless, AI can provide you with valuable support in almost every after-sales scenario. On the one hand, AI could automatically send the package tracking via E-Mail, while on the other hand it also can check the tracking number if requested by the customer.</p>
  <h3>Let’s put this in perspective:</h3>
  <p class="t-blog">Imagine your shop has 50 orders per day.  Approximately 10 of the customers will try to reach out via phone to share their concerns with you. If one phone call takes 5 minutes on average, then you would spend almost one hour per day on the phone. From Monday to Friday!</p>
  <p class="t-blog">Let's push this example a bit further. You would spend almost five hours per week, 20 hours per month and 240 hours per year on the phone! That’s pretty much 26 working days, assuming 9-hour shifts.</p>
  <p class="t-blog quote-gr-blue"><strong>Once your After-Sales Service is on Autopilot you could spend 26 working days on expanding your business. And all thanks to the magic of AI.</strong> </p>

  <h2 class="m10">5. Improved Customer Communications</h2>
  <p class="t-blog">I think we all know that moment when you visit an actual Retail Store and you would like to discuss TV options with one of the employees. There you stand checking the prices and features, but it seems like nobody is taking care of you. Well, probably you would not place your order in such a Retail Store and neither would I.</p>
<p class="t-blog quote-gr-blue"><strong>People buy goods, where the service fits their needs. And a good service always comes along with good communication. Because as you know, communication is key!</strong> </p>
<p class="t-blog">One solution, which focuses on great communication in an online environment is our friend the Chatbot. Especially, when he has been fine-tuned with AI.</p>

<p class="t-blog">A well-developed Chatbot can do way much more than just answering questions. Chatbots, which use AI and machine learning can relate any conversation to previous ones and pick an optimized pathway to answer all sorts of questions. </p>
<p class="t-blog">And with the benefit of machine learning, it can predict the best moment to suggest the right product to the right customer. And this is something that will not only help the customer, but drive Sales.</p>
